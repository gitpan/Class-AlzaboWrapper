0.05  2004-06-25

- Added a new method, alzabo_attributes(), which can be called to find
out what methods were created by calling import.  Also added
_record_attribute_creation() so a custom subclass can record that it
created an attribute method.


0.04  2004-04-23

- The last release broke the table_to_class() method (note to self:
tests would be good).


0.03  2004-04-23

- Make the table() method work in subclasses of classes which inherit
from Class::AlzaboWrapper.


0.02  2004-01-26

- Make it possible to subclass this class by providing caller and base
parameters to import.
